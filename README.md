Android is a mobile operating system developed by Google. It is based on the Linux kernel. Android used by several smartphones and tablets. Android is open to everyone: developers, designers and device makers. That means more people can experiment, imagine and create things the world has never seen.
The Android OS is divided into various version numbers, implying significant jumps in features, operation, and stability, which usually have codenames. So, if you hear someone say Android Marshmallow, Nougat, Oreo, Pie, or the latest Android 11, that is just the name of the version of Android you might have on your device.
